# Development Workflow
Development.  
Testing.  
Deployment.  
And then additional development and redeploying.  
### Flow Specifics
We are going to use github as a central coordination point for all the code that is going to be written and deployed.  

We are going to work with a feature branch and a master brance.  

With the pull request from the feature branch to the master we are going to setup the workflow with Travis CI. Travis will pull your code and test it. Then travis will push the code to AWS hosting.  

### Dockers Purpose
Docker makes some of the above tasks easier. It's just a tool.
