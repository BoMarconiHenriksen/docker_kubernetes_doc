# The Deployment Process
1. Create a Github Repo.  
2. Tie repo to Travis CI.  
3. Create Google Cloud project.  
4. Enable billing for the project.  
5. Add deployment scrips to the repo.  
### Google Cloud vs AWS for Kubernetes
1. Google created Kubernetes.  
2. AWS only "recently" got Kubernetes support.  
3. Far, far easier to poke around Kubernetes on Google Cloud. Has a cloud console thats wired up to your production.  
4. Excelent documentation for beginners.
