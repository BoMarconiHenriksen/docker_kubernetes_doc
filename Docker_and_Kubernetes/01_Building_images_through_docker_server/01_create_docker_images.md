# Creating Docker Images
Build your own images so you can run your app inside that image.  
A dockerfile is a configuration to define how our container should behave.  
The docker server creates an image based on the dockerfile.  
### Flow of creating a dockerfile
1. Specify a base image.
2. Run some commands to install additional programs.  
3. Specify a command to run on container startup.
