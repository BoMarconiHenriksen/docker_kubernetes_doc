# Travis CI Setup
Travis will watch for code changes when we push code to the repository.  
Travis will then pull the code. Test it and then deploy it to AWS.  
1. Go to https://travis-ci.org/  
2. Sign in.  
3. Find docker-react repository and turn the switch on.  
If you can't see the repository you just activated logout and then login to Travis.
