# Skaffold

##### Fast local Kubernetes Development
Optimized source-to-k8s - Skaffold detects changes in your source code and handles the pipeline to build, push, and deploy your application automatically with policy based image tagging and highly optimized, fast local workflows.  

In practice, Skaffold can:  
1. Detect changes in the source code and automatically build, push and deploy.  
2. Automatically update image tags, so you donâ€™t have to do that manually in the Kubernetes manifest files.  
3. Build/deploy/push different applications at once, so it is a perfect fit for microservices too,
support both development and production environment, by running the manifests only once, or continuously watching for changes.  

We will use it locally.
